### v0.1.1 - ?

- Gave glTFs created from quantized-mesh terrain tiles a more sensible material with a `metallicFactor` of 0.0 and a `roughnessFactor` of 1.0. Previously the default glTF material was used, which has a `metallicFactor` of 1.0, leading to an undesirable appearance.
- Reported zero-length images as non-errors as `BingMapsRasterOverlay` purposely requests that the Bing servers return a zero-length image for non-existent tiles.

### v0.1.0 - 2021-03-30

- Initial release.
